#### Classification
st.subheader('Classifying movie arcs')
st.markdown('''We generated a simplified version of the emotional arcs for all the movies database and
            made sure to have a consistent 30 data points per movie to start the classification of the arcs.

st.markdown('''Then, we standardized each movie arc and applied PCA before running the Kmeans clustering algorithm
            on our dataset. After testing several standardization and normalization techniques, as well as different
            numbers of centroids, we got 6 main clusters for the movie arcs.

st.markdown('''We can see that the classified movies arcs mostly follow the same shape of the movie arcs but that there are
            some outliers that were probably hard to classify. We computed a score of similarity between each
            movie arc and their classification using cosine similarity and decided that movies with scores above 0.5
            are relevant enough.

### Recommendation
st.subheader('Recommending movies with the same type of story')
st.markdown('''Our last goal was to recommend movies that have the same type of emotional arc.
            We used cosine similarity to compute a similarity score between a movie and all the other movies from the database.

st.markdown('''We computed the cosine similarity between the arcs and our preprocessed metadata. We kept
            the most similar movies using the average of both scores. The movie arcs were still similar

Burbank, California 91522 All Rights Reserved \\x0cFADE IN:  EXT. SPOOKY ISLAND - NIGHT  A full moon pokes a white hole in a black sky. 0.S. we hear FESTIVE ROCK ‘N ROLL and the WHOOPS and HOLLERS of JOYFUL REVELERS.  We PAN DOWN TO Spooky Island, a tropical island/theme park. This cheesy tourist trap is hardly a Disneyland or Magic Mountain, nor even, sad to say, a Legoland. Like Rome, it was not built in a day. Unlike Rome, it very well likely could have been.  We PASS a colorful Fiberglass “haunted\" castle that sits atop a small mountain. We PASS palm trees and huge papier mache heads impaled on stakes. We APPROACH a lit sign that reads: °  WELCO E TO SP ORY ISLAND WHERE FEAR IS Y UR ONLY FRIEND  We MOVE PAST the sign and OUT OVER a crowd of college students. Dancing. Partying. Pouring beer on themselves and each other. Men in skeleton costumes pounce out of the shadows frightening nary a soul.  We MOVE TO a film crew following a pretty, peppy REPORTER. The Reporter walks through the young people. We MOVE WITH her. She speaks loudly to be heard over the revelry.  REPORTER Students the world over are trading in the sandy beaches of Florida for a completely different Spring Break experience here on Spooky Island!  The Reporter arrives at a large-breasted LASS in a bikini.  REPORTER What’s your name?  LASS Barbara!  REPORTER  Has your experience here on Spooky Island been, well, spooky?  LASS Last night I threw up five times! That was kinda whacked!  (CONTINUED) \\x0cCONTINUED:  We MOVE ON, PAST cardboard gravestones wobbling in the WIND. PAST island natives -- that is, employees of various ethnicities wearing grass skirts and war paint -- holding a limbo stick for students. PAST a hunchback boinking giggling visitors with a plush hammer.  We ARRIVE AT a rocky mountainside, where a young, sullen- looking woman, ISABEL ROGERS, sits on the stoop of a fake gallows. Isabel is \"Goth.\" She wears all black. Her hair is dyed black and gelled into tall spikes. Her eyes are circled by thick, dark rings of makeup.  Two fat, sweaty students slam their hairy bellies together in front of her.  ISABEL This place sucks.  Isabel’s friend MANDY stands beside her, peering through a tiny window on a door that reads \"STAFF ONLY.\" The door leads into the mountainside. Mandy is a pretty, fresh-faced blonde with a pierced nose. MANDY  No dizz-oubt. I can’t see  nothing. Mandy tries the doorknob. It’s not locked.  MANDY Whoa. Hey, Isabel, come on.  ISABEL Why would you want to go in there?  Mandy enters the staff doorway.  MANDY (0.S.) Better than frat central out here.  Isabel looks around nervously. She slips in behind Mandy. INT. CATACOMB CORRIDOR  Mandy and Isabel peer down a long stretch of a dark cavernous hall. We hear WATER DRIPPING.  ISABEL Weird.  (CONTINUED) \\x0cCONTINUED:  MANDY They should let us come in here, man. S’way scarier than those  Silence of the Lambs bumper boats. Isabel and Mandy creep down the hall. They discover an adjoining hallway to their right. Planks of wood cover the rocky walls. Mandy heads down it. ISABEL  Mandy, let’s go back, okay? INT. WOODEN HALL Isabel follows Mandy down the hall.  After a moment, Isabel looks behind her. A pair of fiery red eyes are staring at them.  ISABEL Mandy...  Mandy turns around. She sees the eyes.  MANDY Ha! It’s another one of those animatronic demon thingama-whats!  Mandy struts down the hall and toward the eyes.  MANDY They want us to come in here! It’s set up to be part of the- park!  Mandy gets closer and sees what’s actually standing there. Her expression drops.  MANDY Iz...?  ISABEL Yeah?  MANDY Run!!  Mandy twirls around. She starts to dash, but something in the dark grabs her. She falls to her belly. She screams.  Isabel sees her yanked back, disappearing into the darkness. The SCREAMING STOPS.  (CONTINUED) \\x0cCONTINUED: Isabel takes off down the hall. The eyes follow her.  The hallway ends in a \"T.\" Isabel darts left.  INT. DOORWAY HALL  Isabel flees from the fiery eyes. Large wooden doors line the hall on both sides. She spots red eyes approaching in front of her as well as behind.  She tries one door. Locked.  She tries another. It swings open. She throws herself inside. .  INT. CATACOMB FRONT OFFICE  Isabel slams the door behind her. She clamps a wooden slab in place, locking it. She turns. The enormous CREATURES SLAM on the door.  A phone sits on a desk. She picks it up. Dials. Sobs. O.S. the PHONE RINGS. An ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS UP.  GARRET (V.0.) You have reached the Rogers residence. Please leave a message at the beep. Beep! No, not that one -- ha ha! This one:  The MACHINE BEEPS.  ISABEL Daddy, please pick up! Some type of demon is chasing me! It just got Mandy! Please, Daddy --  The DOOR SHATTERS beside her. Isabel screams. She drops the phone and runs through another door. INT. CATACOMB OFFICE  Isabel slams shut another door behind her. Deadbolts it. She turns. She sees: .  The walls of the room are plastered with newspaper clippings, magazine articles, and photographs. She looks quickly from one to the other: \\x0cNEWSPAPER ARTICLE  reads, \"TEENAGE SLEUTHS REVEAL BLACK KNIGHT GHOST AS HOAX.\" A photo pictures the Mystery, Incorporated gang: Shaggy Rogers, Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and the huge Great Dane, Scooby-Doo.  MAGAZINE HEADLINE  reads, \"MYSTERY INC. SOLVE ENIGMA OF JUMPING GHOST CLOWN: Springs on Bottom of Shoes.\" There is a photo of the gang with the aforementioned shoes.  POSTER AD  with Scooby-Doo and a cyclops monster eating Scooby Snacks reads: \"Scooby and the Cyclops have this mystery solved: Scooby Snacks are DELICIOUS!\"  BACK TO SCENE  Isabel stares at the articles, confused, and whispers:  ISABEL Scooby-Doo?  The DOOR CRASHES down. Isabel screams in horror.  The SCOOBY-DOO THEME SONG begins.  START CREDIT SEQUENCE - MONTAGE  The CREDIT SEQUENCE is a MONTAGE of historical records: PANS of magazine and newspaper articles, old Tv footage, and interviews documenting the rise and fall of Mystery, Inc. The following are some of the snippets for inclusion:  TV FOOTAGE - INT. STUDIOS  A Host stands on a colorful, Peter Max-ish studio set for a cheesy variety show.  HOST (V.0O.)

She wears thick spectacles that distort her eyes and an orange cowl-neck sweater. She smiles politely and nods.  HOST (V.O.) And Scooby-Doo!  SUPERIMPOSE: SCOOBY-DOO!  Here comes Scooby, leaping like a joyous idiot onto the stage. He’s the familiar tongue-wagging canine we know and love, brown with black spots, gargantuan, goofy, and gangly. He slides toward us happily until he realizes he’s sliding toward the edge of the stage. He panics, trying to stop himself, but is unable. He falls into the front row.  Scooby’s head pops up amongst the crowd. He chuckles his trademark laugh. \\x0cINSERT - NEWSPAPER ARTICLE  The headline reads: \"MYSTERY INC. STOPS HEADLESS HORSEMAN’S WAVE OF MAYHEM WITH FIRE HOSE.\" It features a grainy photo of the gang spraying a fire hose at the \"Headless Horseman“ on his white mare.

SHAGGY’S HOUSE - NIGHT  Rain falls on this ramshackle, gray, suburban home. The lawn is overgrown. The roof is caving in. The gutter hangs. Duct tape keeps a cracked window in place.  O.S., a PHONE RINGS.  INT. SHAGGY’S KITCHEN  A rotary phone sits on a counter crowded with dirty pots and pans. Drops of RAIN PLINK against a window behind it. The PHONE RINGS again.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c11. CONTINUED:  A dog’s front paw picks up the receiver.  Scooby-Doo brings the phone to his ear. He yawns, sleepy-eyed. He’s just woken up. The rain on the window projects curling shadows onto the fur of his face.  SCOOBY Rello?  GARRET (V.0O.) Scooby! ?  SCOOBY Yeah, yeah. Rooby reaking.  GARRET (V.O.) (erying) This is Shaggy’s Uncle Garret. It’s my daughter, Isabel. I got a call from her on Spooky Island --  Scooby’s eyes flood with fear.  SCOOBY Rooky! ?  GARRET (V.0O.) She claimed she was being chased by some sort of demon -- !  SCOOBY Remons?!  Scooby slams down the receiver, hanging up on Garret. He stares at it, fearfully.  The PHONE RINGS again. Scooby picks it up, attempting a Spanish accent:  SCOOBY Hola!?  GARRET (V.O.) Scooby, I’m not an idiot! I know this is you! SCOOBY El robody-o rame-o el Roobido here. Scooby hangs up the phone again. He paces back and forth. Dog whines. Bites his nails.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c12. CONTINUED :  It RINGS again. Scooby picks it up as if it were a dead pet. He holds the receiver a few inches from his ear.  GARRET (V.0.) Put my nephew on the phone! He’s --  Scooby looks up to see a dark shape stumbling out of the bedroom toward him.  SHAGGY Scooby-Doo... where are you?  Shaggy Rogers stumbles into the bedroom doorway. He is in his green T-shirt and tightie-whities. He scratches his butt. He squints to shut out the light. 7  SHAGGY Who is it?  Scooby quickly hangs up the phone, futilely hoping Shaggy won\\'t notice.  SCOOBY Robody.  SHAGGY Come on, man. Like I just watched you on the phone.  Scooby shakes his head, denying it. He’s a total liar. THUNDER CRACKS.  The PHONE RINGS. Shaggy reaches for the phone. Scooby jumps to block him.  EXT. COOLSVILLE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY  The Coolsville campus is nearly abandoned for spring break. A couple kids play Frisbee with a golden retriever.  INT. GARRET ROGERS’ OFFICE  PROFESSOR GARRET ROGERS weeps. He is a stout man with glasses too small for his bald skull. He sits in an ergonomic chair. A framed photo of Shaggy and Isabel, smiling with their arms slung over each other’s shoulders, is propped on his desk. Advanced degrees cover his walls. A nervous Scooby and Shaggy are seated with him. A tape recorder plays on his desk.  (CONTINUED ) \\x0c13. CONTINUED :  ISABEL Some type of demon is chasing me! It just got Mandy! Please, Daddy --  We hear the DOOR SHATTER; ISABEL SCREAMS, the PHONE DROPS; the LINE GOES DEAD. Garret hits the stop button.  GARRET The police won’t do anything! They said it’s a haunted theme park, it’s normal for people to get panicked calls!  SHAGGY When’s Isabel supposed to get back?  GARRET  At the end of spring break. A week from tomorrow.  SHAGGY Maybe we should like wait until --  GARRET No! Something strange is going on. These Spooky Island reps won’t let me speak to my own daughter.  Garret pushes forward two open Coolsville U yearbooks on his desk.  SHAGGY What’s this?  GARRET I’ve done some research. These three students all went to the Island last year.  Three students’ photos are circled in pencil. Angel Fawn is a Mohawked-punk rocker. Andrew Cozine is a black rapper with wraparound sunglasses and shapes shaved in his hair. Floyd Pepper is a Deadhead wearing a tie-dyed shirt.  SHAGGY These yearbooks belong to the library! You could get in trouble for drawing on them!  (CONTINUED) \\x0c14. CONTINUED:  Garret shows them two newer yearbooks next to the old ones. The same students’ pictures aré circled. Angel’s hair is now blonde and permed. Andrew sports glasses and a bow tie. Floyd is a crew-cutted jock. They are all smiling, happy and conservative.  GARRET These are their pictures from this year, since they’ve returned.  SHAGGY zoinks.  GARRET In addition to their appearance, their G.P.A.’s have risen dramatically. They were formally disciplinary problems, but no longer. Angel, she edits the school paper. Floyd’s become the quarterback for the Coolsville Flower Powers... What do you think it could be?!  SHAGGY It’s probably... a magic potion.  Garret grips tightly to Shaggy’s forearm, breaking down. Fluids drip from his nose.  GARRET A magic potion? Dear Lord! Shaggy, you have to go to Spooky Island! You have to find Isabel! You have to solve this mystery!  SHAGGY Uncle Garret, stuff from your nose is touching my arm!!  Shaggy yanks his arm away.  SHAGGY I don’t know how to do a mystery --  GARRET  You were a profession detective for four years!  SHAGGY Yeah, but I wasn’t, you know, like paying attention!  (CONTINUED) \\x0c15. CONTINUED :  Garret places some cash on the table.  GARRET My savings. Do whatever you need to find my baby princess. And I have something here for Scooby, if he’1l go with you.  SCOOBY Ro way!  Garret pulls a bag of Scooby Snacks (TM) out of a vase.  SCOOBY Rooby Racks?!  Scooby rolls over on the carpet like a nincompoop. He knocks over an end table and lamp. Garret looks at Shaggy.  SHAGGY He’s doing tricks. That’s rolling over.  Scooby unsheathes a display sword from the wall over the desk. He pretends to repeatedly stab himself by jabbing the sword in his armpit. He falls onto his back.  SHAGGY Playing dead.  GARRET Scooby, the whole bag is yours if you go to this Spooky Island and find my daughter.  Scooby stands.  SCOOBY Rokay! I’11 rill the remons!     Scooby slashes the sword, growling ferociously.  SHAGGY Uncle Garret, Fred and Velma figured out everything. I was just the guy that carried their  bags.  GARRET Then get your friends to come along.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c16.  CONTINUED : SHAGGY We haven’t spoken in two years. GARRET Please. You love Isabel as much  as I do.  Shaggy stares compassionately at his uncle. It’s obvious he does love his cousin.  Just then, Scooby, pretending to be a swashbuckler, accidentally slices Shaggy’s shoulder with the sword.  SHAGGY OQw!! Why are you playing with a sword?!  Scooby points at Garret.  SCOOBY Re did it.  SHAGGY No, he didn’t! I was looking at him!  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATER  Welcome to the 28th Annual Coolsville Science Fiction Convention. Awkward fan boys, middle-aged men dressed as superheroes, and B-movie starlets in skimpy femalien costumes cross in front of a placard outside an auditorium. The placard reads:  COOLSVILLE ASTRO-CON PRESENTS: FORMER MYSTERY BASHER, FRED JONES, discussing his new book, E.S.P./Schmee. S.P. INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM  FRED JONES at a podium. He holds a remote control. Only ten or so bored fans sit in the large auditorium.  FRED And then there was the time, of course, when I solved the mystery of -- Fred presses the remote, flashing a... Slide of a phony seaweed monster.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c17.  CONTINUED:  FRED -- the seaweed-covered ghost,~ exposing him as...  Fred clicks to a slide of the seaweed-covered ghost, unmasked.  Slide  Slide  Slide  Slide  FRED ++. aman in a mask.  of the Aztec ghost, chasing Shaggy.  FRED The Aztec ghost was quite a challenge until I discovered --  of the Aztec ghost, unmasked.  FRED That he was a man in an Aztec ghost mask.  of the abominable snowman ghost.  FRED But I guess you’d say I’m most remembered for revealing to the world that the abominable snowman ghost --  of the abominable snowman ghost, unmasked. FRED Was actually a man inside of a ma. Kk. BOY raises his hand. FAN BOY  Do you think there’s such a real thing as a real ghost?  FRED My new book, E.S.P./Schmee.S.P.,  addresses that issue, my friend. After years of investigating supernatural claims I have arrived at one utter and unassailable conclusion: There are no such entities as ghosts, ghouls, goblins, or monsters.  (MORE)  (CONTINUED) \\x0c18. CONTINUED:  FRED (CONT\\'D) At the end of every paranormal claim there are only fools seeking fame, paranoid imaginations, or charlatans looking to make a buck.  There is absolutely -- absolutely -- no suc’ hi: as magic in this  world.  Beat.  FRED Any other questions?  A maladjusted FAT KID raises his hand.  FAT KID Yeah. Why do you suck?  The other kids in the auditorium crack up. Fred smiles, blushes, attempts to be a good sport, when he spots...  Shaggy and Scooby in the rear of the auditorium. Scooby waves excitedly.  FRED Shagster?  INT. FRED\\'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER  Fred sits with Shaggy and Scooby. The yearbooks and a tape recorder are in front of him.  FRED Well, it’s obvious some sort of man in a mask apprehended your cousin. The important question is... What kind of mask?  SHAGGY So you’1l go with us?  FRED Can’t, Shag. My book tour. Tomorrow I’m off to Evanston, I --  SHAGGY But what about these pictures?  FRED It’s either a coincidence, or they all got jobs at Disneyland.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c19.  CONTINUED: SHAGGY Or a magic potion. FRED  Shaggy. There is no such thing as supernatural phenomena.  SHAGGY Like you’re leaving out the proven entities, right?  FRED Such as?  SHAGGY Leprechauns.  SCOOBY Ralking relerons!  SHAGGY Yeah, walking skeletons.  SCOOBY Rankenrerries.  SHAGGY  Right, Fr -- No, Scoob. Frankenberry’s a guy on a cereal  box.  (to Fred) Right? He’s not a real guy, is he?  Fred is struck by an idea.  FRED It could be a hypno-wheel.  SHAGGY Those red-and-white twirly things that make you act like a chicken?  FRED (nodding) Amnesty International has declared hypno-wheels a violation of basic human rights, ever since Pol Pot employed one during the Khmer Rouge.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c20. CONTINUED :  SHAGGY Think of it, Fred! That’d be the kind of thing that could get a guy, like, global press. Right?  + FRED (smiling) Out of rinky-dink fan conventions and back on Leno.  INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE  A group sits in a circle of chairs. A PSYCHOLOGIST reads from a list on her clipboard.  PSYCHOLOGIST Velma Dinkley... Why don’t you tell us why you enrolled in group therapy?  Velma Dinkley is within the circle. She has a difficult time sharing her feelings.  VELMA My fellow students in the Ph.D. mathematics program told me I was...  PSYCHOLOGIST Bitter?  VELMA I was in a group for a long time where I didn’t get the credit I deserved. No one noticed me,  and... PATIENT #1 What was the group? VELMA (mumbling) Mystery, Incorporated. PATIENT #2 The guys with the big dog? PSYCHOLOGIST Scooby-Doo? PATIENT #1  Right! And Fred Jones.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c21. CONTINUED:  Velma nods, uncomfortable, half-attempting a smile.  PATIENT #3 Yeah! They had that chick, Daphne.  PATIENT #2 Oh my God, she was hot! She was Bo hot!  PATIENT #1  Which one were you? VELMA Velma... She just said my name a second ago. PATIENT #1 I don’t remember a Thelma. EXT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S PARKING LOT - LATER  Velma exits the office with the other patients. She doesn’t socialize. She heads to her Dodge.  She hears a CAR HONK. And turns.  The colorful Mystery Machine van is here. It’s rusted, beaten, and faded. Fred, Shag, and Scoob wait in it.  VELMA Jinkies. INT. MYSTERY MACHINE - LATER  Velma sits in the parked van with Shaggy and Fred.  VELMA Where’d you find the Mystery Machine?  FRED  I tracked it down on eBay a couple years back! I charge fans fifteen bucks for a ride around the block.  An angry Scoob is tightly crossing his arms in the back seat.  VELMA What’s wrong with him?  (CONTINUED) \\x0c22. CONTINUED:  SHAGGY He’s still miffed you called him a moron when we were breaking up.  FRED Well, Scoob, you have to admit -- relatively speaking, measured against a human, you are a moron.  Scooby, offended, snatches a notebook off the back seat. He furiously writes something on it.  FRED So, Velma, are you in? This’1ll be a real doozy of a news story if all five of us go.  VELMA On one condition. When we announce the hypno-wheel to the press, I take the TV interviews.  Scooby shows the notebook to Velma, to prove that he’s not a moron. It reads:  12 +7  = 12  VELMA That’s not right.  Scooby fiddles with the equation. Fred looks at Shaggy.  FRED But it’s tradition that I do that.  VELMA Fine. Forget it.  FRED Breaking tradition, that’s like... hanging turds on a Christmas tree.  SCOOBY I rid rat once.  SHAGGY Don’t remind me, Scoob!  Velma sits, saying nothing, staring forward.  FRED Well... Heck, all right.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c23. CONTINUED:  Fred ruffles Velma’s hair like a little kid. She angrily slaps his hand away.  EXT. JAPANESE GARDEN - LATER  Scooby, Shaggy, Velma, and Fred cross the garden toward a dojo. Scooby is still writing in the notebook. A sign reads \"TAI CHI ACADEMY.\"  VELMA Okay, when we get in there, just follow my lead. Daphne’s not going to want to go because of Fred.  FRED Why? She digs me.  Scooby holds up the notebook again:  12 +7 = 125  VELMA No.  Velma opens the door. A martial arts match is occurring.  INT. DOJO  Daphne, in a dashing eggplant karate robe with a lime belt, is taking on numerous students at once. An INSTRUCTOR watches. She karate chops an attacking Asian student in the neck.  Two students hurl themselves toward her. She somersaults over them. She downs one with a swipe to the spine and another with a heel to the kidney.  Daphne stands frozen, crouched, her fist out in front of her in Flying Lotus stance. The students lie in mangled pain around her. INSTRUCTOR Excellent, Daphne-san. You are learning to harness your chi. They hear clapping. Daphne turns to see the gang.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c24. CONTINUED:  DAPHNE What are you doing here? - (to Fred) Especially you?  FRED Hey. Don’t be sharp just ‘cause Freddy gave you the heave-ho.  SCOOBY (to Fred) Re ras rinky. DAPHNE I was stinky?! SHAGGY  Clingy. He said you were clingy.  DAPHNE I broke up with you, Freddy!  VELMA Mystery Ink is reforming.  DAPHNE Yippee. My answer’s no way!  VELMA I understand. Let’s go, guys.  Everyone, following Velma’s lead, starts to leave. This startles Daphne.  DAPHNE Where are you go -- What do you mean, ‘you understand?’  VELMA It’s easy for us. But for you, always getting captured and tied up, always having to be saved by someone else. I can see where being the damsel in distress is humiliating.  DAPHNE But I’m not like that anymore! I’ve slowly kind of turned my body into sort of a dangerous weapon! Velma smiles patronizingly. She and the others exit.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c25. CONTINUED:  Daphne stands, agonized, torn. She beats her hands  against her forehead, Annette Bening-style. Then she succumbs.  DAPHNE Dammit. Wait!  EXT. COOLSVILLE AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING - DAY  A plane takes off overhead.  INT. COOLSVILLE AIRPORT BATHROOM Daphne stands with Velma.  DAPHNE Those guys are gonna look like total, total idiots when they’re captured and then I’m the one that’s saving them!... Scooby, hold still!  She\\'s putting lipstick on a distracted Scooby. He wears a gray wig, floppy bonnet, and a pair of teardrop, jewelry-studded glasses. Daphne holds an old lady\\'s driver’s license up beside his face.  DAPHNE What do you think? Does he look like my grandma-ma?  Velma stares without expression at Daphne.  INT. COOLSVILLE AIRPORT Fred wheels his luggage to a list of TWA departure times.  The board lists flights to L.A., St. Louis, New York, as well as one flight to Spooky Island, leaving at 4:10.  SHAGGY expertly plays a fifty cent crane machine. The grabber grips a stuffed dragon. Shaggy guides it into the slot. Hoots triumphantly. Spots Fred. SHAGGY  Fred! Check out all these things  I wont! Pred eyes a pile of stuffed creatures beside Shaggy.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c26. CONTINUED : FRED  Cool. Where are k.d. lang and Malibu Barbie?  SHAGGY Disguising Scooby. Like, ‘cause if he has to ride in a kennel he gets all claustrophobic.  Fred, horrified, sees something down the hall behind Shag.  FRED Oh my God.  SCOOBY  is having a heck of a time staying upright in high heels. Daphne helps him walk. His body wavers and jerks.  A YOUNG BOY and his MOMMY pass Scooby. The Boy points. YOUNG BOY Mommy, what’s wrong with that lady?  Mommy smiles at Scooby. She speaks out of the side of her mouth while shoving her son’s pointing finger down.  MOMMY Be nice, Larry. She has a disease. Daphne whispers to Scooby.  DAPHNE Good boy. Just keep your balance.  They arrive at Shaggy and Fred. A pleased Scooby freakishly grins and gives them the thumbs-up.  SCOOBY Rooby rockin’ good!?  Velma won’t look directly at him. VELMA Make him cut that out. It’s creepy.  Fred theatrically throws his palm downward in the middle of the gang. The others stare at him.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c27.  CONTINUED ;  SHAGGY  What? - FRED  Before we get on the plane, let’s  do that thing where we put our  hands on top of each other, then  lift them up and go, ‘Whoo hoo!’ SCOOBY  Rokay!  Scooby puts his paw on Fred’s hand.  SCOOBY Roo _ hoo!  FRED Wait for everybody, Scoob.  SCOOBY Rorry.  Fred stares at the others, pumped up, grinning widely. DAPHNE I’m not going to do it unless Velma and Shaggy do it.  SHAGGY People are watching.  Velma shakes her head a little and grimaces. The three of them walk away.  Fred and Scooby stand alone, their fake smiles fading, their hands on top of each other.  SCOOBY Roo hoo?  INT. AIRPORT GATE - MOMENTS LATER  An AIRPORT CLERK collects tickets at the gate. Passengers file by.  AIRPORT CLERK Please have I.D. ready with your ticket!  Daphne shows the Clerk her driver’s license.  (CONTINUED ) \\x0c28. CONTINUED:  The Clerk nods, rips her ticket, and Daphne passes through. -  Shaggy, peering nervously back, gives him his ticket and ID. The Clerk rips his ticket, and Shaggy passes through.  Scooby hands the Clerk his ticket and ID.  The Clerk looks at the photo of Daphne’s grandmother.  Scooby, pretending to have no teeth, does a melodramatic senior citizen voice.  SCOOBY I’m a rittle old rady!  The Clerk stares at him. Velma, behind Scooby, explains. VELMA Since that photo my grandmother’s contracted acromegaly. (whispered) The Elephant Man disease. The Clerk nods sympathetically. He rips the ticket. AIRPORT CLERK God bless you, ma’am. EXT. AIRPLANE - EVENING  The plane soars over the sunset and wispy clouds.  INT. AIRPLANE  College students abound, many of them tattooed punks and Goth rockers and hippies. Scooby, Shaggy, and Fred sit across the aisle from an upper crust coed.  Scooby notices a cat in a Sherpa bag in the space at the feet of the coed. The CAT HISSES at him.  Scooby, still dressed as the old lady, growls. His lip rolls up. The coed gives Scooby an uneasy look.  SHAGGY (sotto voce) Scooby, cut it out.  Scooby stops.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c29. CONTINUED:  SCOOBY Rorry. 7  Fred has hypno-wheel notes and diagrams on a tray in front of him. But he ignores them for a moment, staring longingly at Daphne, who sits a couple rows down.  SHAGGY You still have like a thing for her, don’t you?  Fred looks at him.  SHAGGY Daphne.  FRED That’s ludicrous.  SHAGGY Then what’s this?  Shaggy points to some doodles next to Fred’s notes: hearts that read \"Fred + Daphne 4ever,\" and the like, and poorly-drawn pictures of Daphne.  Fred scrambles and shuts it.  FRED Don’t be touching my private things!  The CAT HISSES at Scooby again. Scooby loses it, barking at the cat. Everyone looks at the barking old lady.  SHAGGY Scooby!  FRED Shaggy, it’s simple behavior modification. To cause a dog to discontinue any action, you flick him on the nose. Observe. Scoob?  Scooby turns to Fred. FRED When you bark, this is what happens. Fred flicks Scooby on the nose. Scooby stares a moment.  Then he punches Fred eight times in the face, hard. \\x0c30. EXT. SPOOKY ISLAND AIRPORT - NIGHT  The gang and students descend a stairwell from the plane. Scooby tears away his disguise, and gazes out at:  A cobblestone walkaway leads from the plane onto this eighth-rate Disneyland. Natives line the walkway. They vend skull key chains, T-shirts, and plastic leis formed to resemble intestines. LOUDSPEAKERS emit SCARY MUSIC.  FRED Okay, gang, let’s spread that photo of Isabel around, see if anyone knows her. Then we’ll see if we can locate the hyno-wheel.  The gang fans out at the bottom of the stairg. They each have a photograph of Isabel, which they show to the natives. Daphne stands with one EMPLOYEE.  DAPHNE She came in last week. Isabel Rogers. Have you seen her?  NICE NATIVE (EMPLOYEE) Boy, I’d like to help. But I haven’t. Sorry.  Shaggy shows a picture to N’GOO TAUNA, a large, friendly albino wearing a slick suit. N’Goo has a strange accent.  N’GOO No, I do not recognize her. Is this your dog?  N’Goo looks at Scooby-Doo. Shaggy nods.  N’GOO It is unarguably the most beautiful animal I have once held eyes on!  ENTHUSED NATIVE May I... pet your dog!?  Shaggy shrugs. The natives gather around Scooby, cooing and awing as they pet him. Scooby digs the attention, but is a bit ticklish. N’Goo looks at Shaggy.  N’GOO I am N’Goo Tauna, the proprietor of the Island’s hotel. You come along in my cart. I drive the Werewolf!  (CONTINUED) \\x0c31. CONTINUED:  A line of golf carts wait at the end of the walkway.  Each cart is adorned with a different monster theme: the Mummy, Dracula, King Kong, a Smurf, etc. (monster theme = a paper-mache monster head on top of the cart).  EXT. WALK OF HORRORS - MOMENTS LATER  N‘Goo drives the Werewolf cart down the cobblestone pathway. Gaudy animatronic statues loom on either side of the lane. The statues are weathered, with parts chipped away: Famous monsters, cheesy ghosts in sheets, and skeletons missing bones. They chomp and grab at passersby.  The gang is crowded together in the cart. Fred and Velma sits the front seat with N’Goo. The rest are in back.  N’GOO You come here to face the demons?  VELMA Yes. And afterwards we’re going to Pirates of the Caribbean to stop the horrible mutilation going on there.  N’GOO Ha ha! One who is doubting!  FRED We’ve come here to disprove your demons. I’m an author. Fred  Jones. N’GOO Mm. Rings no bells. FRED Perhaps you know one of my books: The Bermuda Triangle, What Crap,  or Bigfoot: Bulls: - N’goo shakes his head.  FRED I’m very famous in the U.S.  Scooby, in the back seat, buries his face in Shaggy’s chest.  SHAGGY It’s okay, Scoob. They’re only machines.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c32. CONTINUED:  Scooby peers up and sees an animatronic Frankenberry chomping on the bloody arm of a dead tittle girl.  Scooby screams at the top of his lungs.  DAPHNE Oh my God. Isn’t that... the cast of ‘Friends’?  It is indeed an animatronic cast of \"Friends.\" Eating a dog.  EXT. ALTAR - MOMENTS LATER  The golf carts pull around a stone altar and a circular stone platform. Weeds poke through the platform\\'s eracked surface. In the center of the platform is a large stone bowl covered with carvings of demons.  The gang gathers beside a moped rental stand beside the platform.  MONDAVARIOUS approaches a podium and microphone on the altar. He is a genuinely spooky bald man with a goatee in the shape of an arrow. He wears mystical flowing purple robes, and he has a large key hanging from his belt. ZARKOS stands by Mondavarious’s side. Zarkos is a huge Mexican ex-wrestler, bare-chested but for crossed suspenders. A mask covers the upper half of his face. Mondavarious, stilted and detached, reads a speech.  MONDAVARIOUS Welcome to Spooky Island. My name is Mondavarious. Locked away in my castle of horrors --  Mondavarious motions toward the colorful fiberglass castle on the mountain.  MONDAVARIOUS I have dedicated my life to the study of demonology and have found demons to be very...  He turns to the next page.  MONDAVARIOUS Frightening. I would like to introduce my bodyguard. His name is Zarkos. You may recognize him from Telemundo as the famous masked wrestler, Zarkos. Good luck. I hope your stay here is a horrifying one.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c33. CONTINUED:  Mondavarious starts to leave, then stops and stares out at the crowd. He says this one thing with feeling:  MONDAVARIOUS Oh, and be sure to return to your lodgings by midnight. Demons prowl the forest after midnight, in search of fresh, young souls.  Mondavarious grins.  SCOOBY jumps into Shaggy’s arms, shivering. SCOOBY  Remons!  NATIVES  stand in filed lines on the circular platform. Flames shoot up from the bowl in the center of the platform.  Drummers drum beside the platform. The Natives do a  synchronized dance. They chant a strange, unearthly song:  NATIVES A ringio a wado set Ba bingam tom anani fett Ree kimio an rako ling This is what we demons sing.  An enormous, diaphanous demon goddess appears in the flame. She has an evil hawk’s head and the body of a voluptuous woman. She wails a siren song.  The college students step back in awe.  SCOOBY AND SHAGGY scream. This time Shaggy jumps in Scooby’s arms. VELMA Look, you chickens. There’s a holographic camera placed --  Velma points out cameras projecting the \"Demon Goddess\" into the center of the flame.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c34. CONTINUED:  VELMA There. And there. And there. It’s just an optical illusion.  SHAGGY Oh. Hal! Holograph!  Shaggy and Scooby giggle and poke each other for being fraidy cats.  Daphne is showing the moped rental guy the picture of Isabel. He shakes his head. She turns towards the others.  DAPHNE No one recognizes Shaggy’s cousin.  FRED We should head up to this Mondavarious fellow’s castle. Seems the most likely place to hide a hypno-wheel.  SCOOBY Ro rastles!  SHAGGY We don’t do castles!  VELMA Why?  SHAGGY  Because castles have paintings with eyes that watch you and knight’s armor that’s a statue but there’s a guy inside who follows you every time you turn around!  DAPHNE Oh, come on, Shaggy! How many times has that happened?  SHAGGY Twelve! I’m not gonna do it. DAPHNE Scooby -- SCOOBY Ruh-uh! FRED Shag--  (CONTINUED) \\x0c35.  CONTINUED : SHAGGY No_way! VELMA The castle will have food. SCOOBY Rood? SHAGGY  You think it has food? Because I didn’t, you know, eat any dinner.  EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER  Four MOPEDS ZOOM uphill, ramping up into the air. Scooby and Shaggy share a moped. Scooby drives, exhilarated. Shaggy holds on for dear life.  SHAGGY Slow down, Scooby! I think a little pee just came out of me!  EXT. MONDAVARIOUS CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER  Velma, Daphne, and Fred SCREECH sideways to a stop, all in a clear line in front of the Disneyesque castle.  Scooby tries to do the exact same thing, but his moped runs into the rest and they all fall down like dominoes.  EXT. MONDAVARIOUS CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER  The gang stands on the castle porch. Velma presses a DOORBELL. It plays a CHEESY MELODY. Scooby and Shaggy are frightened. Fred is excited.  FRED A hypno-wheel could be our biggest coup since we teamed up with the Harlem Globetrotters and opened a can of whoop-ass on Redbeard’s ghost!  No one answers the door.  SHAGGY No one’s here. Let’s go.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c36. CONTINUED:  VELMA Let’s see if the door is unlocked. Scooby, try the door.  SCOOBY Rhy re?  VELMA Because if a demon tears your head off, we\\'ll have a warning.  Scooby-Doo whines, holding up his limp paw. Shaggy pulls a Scooby snack from his pocket.  SHAGGY Will you it for a Scooby snack?  Scooby brightens. He opens his mouth wide. Shaggy throws one up in the air and Scooby catches it.  Scooby gags. The snack is caught in his throat. A panicked Shaggy gives him the Heimlich maneuver.  Daphne, fed up, turns the doorknob herself. It’s open. She walks inside.  Scooby coughs up the snack. It propels into a small moat.  INT. CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER  The others enter behind Daphne. The castle interior contrasts the phoney exterior; it’s decorated in a colorful, suburban way: shag carpeting, flowered wallpaper.  SHAGGY Zoinks. Not quite what I expected.  SCOOBY  Rive re another Rooby Rack!  SHAGGY The rest are in my suitcase.  Scooby makes a face as if Shaggy killed his mother. FRED Okay, let’s split up and look for clues. Daphne, you and I --  (CONTINUED) \\x0cCONTINUED:  37.  DAPHNE I don\\'t think so, Fred. I know where your mind goes when we get trapped in a mummy’s tomb!  FRED Why are you all huffy? What did I ever do to you?  DAPHNE You cheated on me, Freddy, with every fan you could get your hands on! You were like a lion with impalas, looking for the ones that were wounded or too young to know any better... I’m going with Shaggy and Scooby.  VELMA Typical.  DAPHNE What?  VELMA  Just like it always was. I was always picked last for the teams.  DAPHNE Teams?  VELMA Your little cliques. You and Fred over here, Shaggy and Scooby over there. I was always the third wheel.  FRED Fine. Velma, come with me. I want you to. I’m very excited about it.  INT. CASTLE - LIBRARY  Daphne runs her fingers along the books on a long  bookshelf,  a combination of Grisham novels, self-help  tomes by Fulghum, and withered volumes on occult  subjects.  Scooby, beside her, can see through a doorway into a  kitchen.  He pokes Shaggy, and they move toward it.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c38. CONTINUED:  Daphne arrives at a book, Men Are From Mars, J am From Hell, by John Gray. She removes it. “As she does, the  bookshelf twirls open, leading into a tiny room.  An ancient text sits on a lectern beneath a single lamp.  INT. CASTLE - HALLWAY  Fred and Velma walk along a wall with framed photos of Anne Geddes’ babies.  VELMA We can split up now. It was nice of you to pretend. But I know you\\'d have rather gone with the other guys. (beat) It’s because I’m ugly, isn’t it?  FRED Velm! No. Heck, stocky chicks turn me on every now and again.  Velma glares at him.  FRED What? That was a compliment.  They pass a picture of a kid dressed up like a cabbage. Its eyes follow them, watching.  INT. CASTLE - LIBRARY  Daphne eyes the heavily-bound text. It reads, in gold: Daemon Ritus.  She opens it to reveal Latin text on parched, crumbling  pages, hundreds of years old. Some passages are marked in yellow highlighter.  INT. CASTLE - KITCHEN  Shaggy and Scooby are covered in food from the refrigerator and cabinets. Shaggy swallows a sardine, and burps.  Scooby-Doo chuckles. He copies Shaggy, letting out a small burp.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c39. CONTINUED:  Shaggy laughs, too. He rolls back his head and burps obnoxiously loud. ~  Scooby yanks on his own tail, pretending this triggers a drawn-out belch.  Shaggy slaps the back of his head and makes a burp fall into his hand, clutching it. He opens his hand and lets the burp out of his hand (burping again).  Scooby concentrates, squinting one eye. He FARTS.  SHAGGY Ha! You asked for it!  Shaggy sticks his butt to the side. He works hard at pushing out a long, uneven-sounding FART.  Daphne enters the kitchen doorway behind Shaggy, holding Daemon Ritus. Shaggy doesn’t see her.  Scooby slices his finger across his throat in a \"cut it out\" gesture.  SHAGGY I don’t think so! I’m not stopping till all your fur is singed off!  Shaggy cracks up as he continues to pass an inhuman amount of gas. Scooby pointing surreptitiously behind Shaggy. Shaggy, still laughing and farting, looks behind him  Daphne stares at him. Shaggy’s smile disappears. His FART STOPS mid-sound.  DAPHNE I thought we were trying to save your cousin.  SHAGGY Yeah. Right. That wasn’t me... That was, um, the, um... plumbing?  Scooby cracks up.  DAPHNE I found this weird book.  Daphne plops the Daemon Ritus on the counter. Scooby and Shaggy peer at it over Daphne’s shoulder. \\x0c40. INSERT - PAGE  Beneath the yellow highlighted text on parched paper, is an illustration of thousands of demons rushing down as humans scream in horror.  BACK TO SCENE  SCOOBY Rake a rood R-rirt.  SHAGGY Yeah! It would make a good T- shirt.  DAPHNE You guys.  She turns the page. Scooby and Shaggy love it.  SCOOBY SHAGGY Oooh! Rool! Whoa!  DAPHNE It’s a demon eating a baby’s head!  SHAGGY Yeah, but you put like, you know, a band name over it.  They hear a DOOR UNLOCKING.  INT. CASTLE Mondavarious and Zarkos enter hurriedly. ZARKOS Two went this way! The others, el cocina!  INT. CASTLE - HALLWAY  Zarkos and Mondavarious move swiftly down the hallway. They move past three large Ming vases.  After they pass them, Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby stick their heads out of them.  DAPHNE Come on!  They start to get out of them. Shaggy panics; his shoulders are lodged in the vase.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c41. CONTINUED:  SHAGGY I’m stuck!  Scooby runs away. Daphne tries to pull Shaggy out, but is unable.  DAPHNE Crap! Scooby, where are you going?  INT. CASTLE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER  Zarkos and Mondavarious enter. Food is all over the kitchen. The Daemon Ritus is on the counter. | Mondavarious runs his finger along the binding. The highlighted pages have been torn away. He turns to Zarkos.  MONDAVARIOUS  Why didn’t you stop them? ZARKOS  I did. They just don’t know it  yet.  EXT. MONDAVARIOUS CASTLE  Fred and Velma are on their mopeds as Scooby gets on his. Daphne rolls the Ming vase with Shaggy in it out the front door.  FRED What are you doing?!  DAPHNE Oh, we just thought it’d be fun to roll Shaggy around in a vase.  FRED Why now? !  VELMA She\\'s kidding.  FRED  Oh.  Daphne closes her eyes. She makes a humming sound. She slowly pulls back her fist.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c42.  CONTINUED : SHAGGY What’s she doing?! I think-she’s gonna hit me!  VELMA She’s summoning her chi.  Daphne’s fist flies forward, SHATTERING the VASE, without touching Shaggy. He’s relieved not to be hurt.  SHAGGY Thanks, Daph.  Daphne smiles. Nods. Straddles her moped.  FRED Let’s all meet back at the hotel.  Daphne, Fred, and Velma take off. Shaggy gets on the moped behind Scooby.  SHAGGY Scooby, you totally abandoned me!  SCOOBY Rorry.  Scooby kick-STARTS his ENGINE. Beside his kickstand, a hole has been poked into the gas tank. Gas streams out. EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER  Fred, Velma, and Daphne zip by, down the steep hill. Shaggy and Scooby are behind them, but their moped is puttering and slowing. Finally, it stops.  EXT. HOLIDAY INN - ESTABLISHING  A brightly-lit hotel in the middle of the dark forest. Fred, Velma, and Daphne are entering.  INT. HOLIDAY INN - LOBBY  As Fred, Velma, and Daphne come through the door, they’re almost toppled by two giggling students in their underwear, chasing and spraying shaving cream on each other.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c43.  CONTINUED: FRED We\\'ll reconvene here at eight~“in the morning.  Velma and Daphne nod.  INT. HOLIDAY INN - BAR - MOMENTS LATER  Velma sits down at a bar beside a longhaired METAL HEAD. She looks at the bartender.  VELMA A Coca-Cola please.  The bartender sets her up with Coke in a glass. METAL HEAD You’re the one I saw talking to those Mystery Ink guys! You know them?  Velma stares at him. On her other side, a mischievous student pours vodka into her Coke. She doesn’t see.  She takes a sip of her Coke. She is surprised by its tasty quality. She takes another.  EXT. FOREST  Scooby and Shaggy stand beside the dead moped.  SCOOBY Re’re out of ras.  SHAGGY  I guess we like have to walk, man.  We better hope we don’t have  fresh, young souls, Scoob! Shaggy laughs loudly. Scooby snickers with vigor. Shaggy laughs a little quieter. Scooby laughs quieter. Shaggy stops laughing. Scooby does too. Shaggy’s mouth is a flat line. Scooby is also not amused. INT. DAPHNE’S HOLIDAY INN ROOM Daphne unpacks her suitcase, which lies open on her bed.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c44. CONTINUED:  She removes an eggplant and pink body suit on a hanger. There’s a KNOCK at the door.  DAPHNE Hold on!  Daphne opens the door. Hey, it’s Fred. He smiles mischievously as he leans against the doorway.  DAPHNE Shaggy and Scooby show up?  FRED Velma’s waiting for them in the bar downstairs.  INT. HOLIDAY INN - BAR  A drunken Velma is held aloft by a cadre of students.  She whoops as she swirls her turtleneck sweater over her head.  BACK TO DAPHNE’S ROOM  FRED They’re probably with her by now. You find any evidence of a hypno- wheel?  DAPHNE No. But I think Mondavarious may take demons more seriously than he lets on.  FRED You’re saying you believe there’s actual demonic activity on this island?  DAPHNE No... But...  Fred starts to enter.  DAPHNE What are you doing?  FRED We have adjoining rooms. I’11 leave my side unlocked.  Daphne puts her hand on his chest, stopping him.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c45.  CONTINUED: DAPHNE You think we’re going to share rooms?! FRED  We have a long history.  DAPHNE So do Godzilla and King Kong. But that doesn’t mean they should have  sex. FRED Come on... I miss you. DAPHNE I want nothing to do with you, Freddy! FRED  We fit together like Legos!  DAPHNE Back then, right. When I was always pretending --  FRED Pretending?  DAPHNE That I was weak and that you were strong and that you were smarter than me! So you’d like me, Fred! All right?  Fred snickers.  DAPHNE You don’t believe me?!  FRED Wellll --  DAPHNE  Remember when the cheddar cheese ghost captured me?!  FRED Sure.  DAPHNE You think I thought he was real?  (CONTINUED) \\x0c46.

And I’1l tell you, that wasn’t the only thing I faked!  FRED Slow down!  DAPHNE But I’m over the co-dependent damsel-in-distress crap. All right? I don’t want you. I don’t like you. And that ‘ascot’? It makes you look gay.  Daphne shuts the door in his face.  EXT. HOLIDAY INN - HALLWAY  Fred stands in front of Daphne’s closed door. He’s speechless for a moment. Then:  FRED That thing on your head... that... barrette... headband... maybe...  Maybe that makes you look gay! Did you ever think of that?!  A maid passes by. Fred smiles at her, embarrassed.  FRED I couldn’t think of anything better.  EXT. WINDING PATH - LATER  Scooby-Doo and a bedraggled Shaggy wend their way up through the forest. Scooby trails a few feet behind. Eerie trees loom over them like phantoms.  SHAGGY My bones are aching. My feet are tired. And my soul is guessing it’s past midnight. Heh.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c47. CONTINUED:  Scooby spots a frog. He playfully tries to slap his paw down on the frog. The frog leaps into the woods. Scooby bounds off after it, disappearing into the trees.  SHAGGY You know what I’m saying, Scoob?

BUSHES RUSTLE beside Shaggy. Relieved, he moves toward the RUSTLING.  SHAGGY Like, what are you doing, man? You’re always messing around, when we\\'re supposed to --  Shaggy separates the branches. Instead of Scoob, he sees:  SHAGGY’S POV  A humongous slit pair of eyes in the darkness, a striking combination of flesh, flames, and black embers.  BACK TO SCENE The flaming eyes spring toward Shaggy. Shaggy runs. The eyes jounce behind him, toward him.  Shaggy stumbles into...  EXT.

HOLIDAY INN - LOBBY  Shaggy and Scooby slam the door shut. They lock the door. They turn and see:  Numerous students in the lobby, watching. Some are gathered on the second floor stairwell, looking down to see what all the commotion is about. The Metal Head and Velma are in front. Velma is sloshed.  METAL HEAD Why were you dudes banging on the door like a bunch of whiny little wusses?  VELMA Thcooby. Doo! You know what Doo ith? Itsth another name for Poop. Your name ith Scooby...Poop!

Scooby gnashes his teeth and walks like a monster.  SCOOBY Ronster! Rig! Ranted to real Rooby-Doo’s roull  FRED How many times do I have to say it? There are no such entities as ghosts, ghouls, goblins, or monsters! At the end of every paranormal claim there are only fools seeking fame, paranoid imaginations, or charlatans looking to make a buck! There is absolutely -- absolutely -- no such thing as magi--  ENORMOUS DEMON  twelve feet tall, SMASHES through the WINDOW. His eyes are flames. His flattened head sinks into his monstrously muscular body. His horrible claws are three feet long. His body is raw, pink, verrucose, and protoplasmic. It’s safe to say this is no man in a mask.  The demon picks Fred up in its huge claws and smashes him against the wall, knocking him unconscious.  INT. HOLIDAY INN - LOBBY  Another demon kicks in the front DOOR, SHATTERING it. The pieces knock Velma down; her glasses fly off.

Some demons breathe a green mist on the students, a kind of gas that promptly knocks the students unconscious. Others slam students against the walls, a quicker job of it. They fling the unconscious youths over their shoulders. They move onto the next victim.  Velma runs her fingers over the carpet, searching for her specs.  VELMA My glathes, My glathes! VELMA’S POV  Vague blob shapes; then, her cracked glasses are handed to her.  VELMA (0.S.) Thankth. That’th... BACK TO SCENE  Velma stands, putting on her glasses.

HOLIDAY INN - BAGGAGE AREA  Scooby-Doo flies into the room behind the front desk. Visitors’ luggage is piled here, waiting to be brought to the proper room. Some demons pass through the hall behind him, unaware of him.  Scooby digs through the suitcases, tossing one out of the way after the other. He arrives at an olive suitcase with flower stickers.  He throws it open. It’s filled with brown corduroys and green shirts. He throws aside the clothes, searching in panic. Then he finds what he’s looking for. He smiles.  It’s the pack of Scooby Snacks Garret gave him.  Shrieking demons burst through the doorway behind him. Scooby tosses a comb at them. As you might imagine, this does little good.  He clutches the Scooby Snack bag in his mouth. He barrels away.  INT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM  Daphne eats yogurt in bed. A very LOUD HONG KONG ACTION MOVIE on TV drowns out the commotion below. She hears a KNOCK at her door.  DAPHNE Fred! Didn’t I tell you --  She walks to the door. Opens it.  Shaggy looks like a maniac. The extremity of the situation has pushed him into a nervous, quiet numbness.  DAPHNE Shaggy?  He puts his finger to his lips. SHAGGY Shbh. (whispering, pointing downstairs) Demons eating people.  DAPHNE Demons what?  Shaggy pushes her inside. He softly shuts the door.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c54. CONTINUED:  SHAGGY We\\'ll jump out the window. -  Shaggy totters to the window. DAPHNE What?! Shaggy, you’re being a weirdo. Get out of my room!  Shaggy pulls up the shade. He peers outside.  DEMONS cling to the bricks, crawling up the side of the hotel. SHAGGY Window’s out. SHAGGY  walks to the front door. He opens it and peeks outside.  DEMON  is SMASHING into rooms along the hallway.  SHAGGY closes the door.  SHAGGY That way’s no good either.  Shaggy notices some suitcase straps on the bed. Picks one up. Begins typing it.  DAPHNE What are you doing?  SHAGGY I’1l make two nooses. We’1ll hang you first. I’11 make sure you\\'re dead. This way like at least they won’t get our souls.  DAPHNE Fine. If you don’t leave, then I will!  Daphne tosses the door open, and moves into... \\x0c55. INT. HOLIDAY INN HALLWAY  Daphne sees the demon. He looks up at her.  INT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM - SECONDS LATER Daphne slams the door shut, locking it.  She’s speechless. Shaggy nods and smiles in understanding.  A demon’s arm SMASHES through the WINDOW. The other demon kicks in the front door.  Daphne back-flips next to the doors that lead from room to room. She opens the first door.  SHAGGY Daphne! No! Grab a noose! Those doorways are only open on one side!  Daphne grabs the knob to the second door. She swings it open. It’ Fred’s room.  DAPHNE Thank God Freddy’s a scumbucket.  A demon is about to grasp Shaggy. Shaggy dives after Daphne into Fred’s room.  INT. FRED‘S HOTEL ROOM  Shaggy locks the door behind him. The demon SLAMS his FIST through the DOOR. It SPLINTERS.  Daphne dashes through the front door.  INT. HOLIDAY INN HALLWAY  As Daphne enters the hall, she finds herself facing another huge demon.  Daphne quickly closes her eyes, thrusts her firsts out, starts humming and summoning her chi.  The demon pokes her in the forehead with his huge finger, knocking her out.  He slings her over his shoulder.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c56. CONTINUED:  Shaggy runs into the hall. He sees Shaggy over the demon’s shoulder. The demon slinks down the hall like an ape.  Shaggy grabs Daphne’s forearm. He yanks. She slides off the demon and into Shaggy’s arms.  Shaggy runs down the hall cradling her. The demon turns, sees Shaggy with Daphne, and takes chase.  Scooby appears, running up the stairwell with the Scooby Snacks (TM) in his mouth. His path converges with Shaggy.  SHAGGY Scooby? What are you do -- ?  Tens of demons rush up the stairwell behind Scooby.  Shaggy, carrying Daphne, and Scooby run down the hall together. The horde of SCREECHING DEMONS chases them.  A window is at the end of the hall.  Scooby leaps toward the window.  EXT. HOLIDAY INN REAR  Scooby-Doo’s gargantuan body CRASHES majestically through the GLASS. Shaggy with Daphne flies out behind him.  They plummet twenty feet. They land on a long awning overhanging the rear recreational area of the hotel. They slide down it, spinning, and are flung splashing into the hotel swimming pool.  The demons leap out the open window after them. But they’re too heavy to slide down the awning. They tear through the fabric and land painfully on the hard concrete.  Scooby and Shaggy and a walking Daphne pull themselves out of the pool. The demons are far behind them. INT. HOLIDAY INN (BOULDER) - MOMENTS LATER  Scooby and Shaggy are hidden behind a large boulder. They’re peeking around it. Daphne is pacing nervously. \\x0c57. DEMONS  in the distance, head in a single file away from the Inn. Unconscious students are slung over their shoulders. The Inn itself is in terrible condition, with shattered ‘windows, doors, and huge holes in walls.  SHAGGY They can’t see us. I guess we’re safe for the time being.  DAPHNE Alrighty. So we need to figure out a way to defeat the demons, and then save Fred and Velma.  SHAGGY That’s sort of like my plan, which was get the heck out of here and let the demons eat Fred and Velma.  Scooby opens his bag of Scooby Snacks (TM). The bag is filled with water. He chews one and gets a sour  expression. He looks at Shaggy, who is dialing his cell phone.  SHAGGY You can’t eat those. They’re soaked in chlorine.  This upsets Scooby. A single tear falls down his face.  DAPHNE What are you doing?  SHAGGY Calling the cops.  DAPHNE Wait! We don’t need the police! Fred and Velma always figured out everything! Now it’s our turn! For the first time they’re the damsels in distress, not me!  SHAGGY Daphne, you just were the damsel in distress. I saved you.     Daphne’s lip quivers with this realization. She slumps to the ground, against the boulder.  DAPHNE Oh... crap. It’s my destiny. I’m trapped in an endless, vicious cycle of being captured and saved.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c58. CONTINUED:  SHAGGY (into phone) - I‘d like to report like a kidnapping. (to Daphne) Get some rest. We’1ll wait here.  Scooby eats his Scooby Snacks with a disgusted look on his face, weeping.  FADE TO:  EXT. SPOOKY ISLAND - DAWN  The sun peeks over the tropical fun park, bleaching away the terror of the night before.  RAIMONDO (V.O.) You the ones called in the kidnapping?  EXT. HOLIDAY INN (BOULDER)  Shaggy and Daphne blink themselves awake. Hardbitten LIEUTENANT RAIMONDO and fresh-faced OFFICER FITZGIBBON stand over them. Scooby is writing something on the rock.  RAIMONDO Lieutenant Emilio Raimondo, U.S. Coast Guard. This is Officer Fitzgibbon.  DAPHNE I\\'m Daphne Blake. Shaggy Rogers.  Scooby pokes Raimondo. He points at an equation he’s written in the dust of the rock.  12 +7  = 3.1415926535898  RAIMONDO Way off.  Raimondo readies his notebook.  RAIMONDO So what’s up?  (CONTINUED) \\x0c59. CONTINUED:  SHAGGY Like last night there were thése demons here and they like smashed up the hotel!  Raimondo looks beyond the boulder at the Holiday Inn. It’s in perfect condition. The shattered windows, smashed doors, and tattered awnings are now new and  clean. Shaggy stares at it in shock. He moves toward it.  RAIMONDO Looks all right now.  SHAGGY They must have, like, come back and cleaned it up. They were like eighteen feet tall!  DAPHNE Shaggy, please... Lieutenant, we\\'re not just some crazy --  Shaggy taps Raimondo’s notebook.  SHAGGY  And they had eyes that were fire! Write that down.  A wholesome couple, happy and in perfect condition, walk out of the hotel. Shaggy and Daphne stare, unnerved.  RAIMONDO Who, by name, has disappeared?  DAPHNE Our friends, Velma Dinkley and Fred Jones.  SHAGGY And every other guest here... except... I guess... those two.  Another twenty students emerge from the hotel, laughing, prepared for a day of fun in the sun. All the students -- once punks, burnouts, and hippies -- are now clean- cut.  Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby are shocked. N’Goo, the albino, approaches the Coast Guard.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c60. CONTINUED:  N‘ GOO Officers, is there’s a problem of some sort here?  RAIMONDO These folks claim their friends were abducted last night.  N’Goo laughs.  RAIMONDO What’s so funny?  N’ GOO They have obviously mistooken our Monster Show for something from their real lives!  RAIMONDO ‘Monster Show’?  N’ GOO I must never pass up opportunities to show the local constabulary a demonstration of our very frightening presentation! Come!  INT. HOLIDAY INN LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER  N’Goo, the Coast Guard, Shaggy, Scooby, and Daphne stand in the lobby. It is also in pristine condition.  N’GOO At the time of midnight, the show begins here. The kids are hanging out. They are having the fun times. Then, all of the sudden:  A \"DEMON\" bursts out of the closet. It’s a man of normal height in a worn, torn costume, a very poor approximation of the demons the night before. A zipper runs down its  back. Its blinking red eyes are fashioned from Christmas lights.  \"DEMON\" Grrrrrrrr! Grrrr!  N’GOO (mock fear) Oh no what is happening! It is an actual demon from Hell! And, then --  (CONTINUED) \\x0c61. CONTINUED:  Two more guys in costumes run out of the bar. One is a MUMMY. The other wears a pink RABBIT costume with fangs glued to it and a thick frown drawn with a Sharpie over its eyes. They growl and wave their arms in an unconvincing manner. -  N‘GOO Oh no! What am I going to do?! I’m forced into throwing peanuts!  In a feigned panic, N’Goo throws a bowl of peanuts at the monsters. The Mummy clutches his eye.  MUMMY Ow!  N‘GOO But it does no good! My life is in danger! They are coming to eat my very soul!  The monsters crowd in on N’Goo. The \"Demon\" bumps into a coffee table. N’Goo turns to the officers.  N‘’GOO See? This is all that happened.  SHAGGY But... like... that isn’t what happened... like at all! They weren’t bad actors in costumes!  RABBIT Four years at Yale Drama, pal.  SHAGGY These guys have zippers on their backs!  N‘GOO Yes, but in the darkness of night... oh ho!  SHAGGY Last night they were... big!  N‘GOO (to Raimondo) One of our actors, Stuart, is not here today. He is six-foot-three. You don’t want to meet him in a dark alley.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c62. CONTINUED:  SHAGGY They had teeth... they breathed  The \"Demon\" presses a bulb under his arm and a green spray sprays out of a tube on his chin.  Raimondo returns his notebook to his pocket. He gives Shaggy a hard stare and speaks to Fitzgibbon.  RAIMONDO Let’s go.  DAPHNE Lieutenant. Our friends Fred and Velma are missing. Now until that mystery is solved, I suggest you unholster your notebook. Okay?  MUMMY Fred and Velma? I saw them this morning, over at Dead Mike’s.  Daphne gawks at the Mummy.  EXT. DEAD MIKE’S SPORTS BAR - LATER  Dead Mike’s is a bright, splashy, island bar, a mixed aesthetic of sports teams and horror. Its logo is a neon skull with baseball bat crossbones.  We hear the MUSIC of SPANDAU BALLET’s \"True.\"  INT. DEAD MIKE’S SPORTS BAR - LATER  Fred sings karaoke melodramatically into a microphone. His ascot is gone. His hair is shorter, above his ear.  FRED ‘So funny how it seems Always in time But never in line for dreams Head over heels when toe to toe This is the sound of my soul! This is the sound!’  Velma ENTERS FRAME, also with a microphone. Her hair is in abun. She’s wearing makeup and a sun dress. She thrusts her fist in front of her, singing with gusto. The crowd whoops and applauds.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c63. CONTINUED:  VELMA ‘I bought a ticket to the world! But now I’ve come back again!’  FRED/VELMA ‘Why do we find it hard to write the next line? Oh we want the truth to be said!’  SHAGGY, SCOOBY, AND DAPHNE  stand in the rear of the crowd, staring in numbed shock. Raimondo and Fitzgibbon are with them.  Velma and Fred grip hands as they sing the chorus together.  FRED/VELMA ‘Huh huh huh hu-uh huh We know this much is true Huh huh huh hu-uh huh We know this much is true’  SHAGGY Zoinks! They’ve been brainwashed! The demons have a hypno-wheel!  DAPHNE (confused, disturbed) I’m going to... the ladies’ room.  Raimondo and Fitzgibbon start to leave.  SHAGGY Wait!  Shaggy notices a pretty young woman beyond Raimondo. She’s clapping and singing along with Fred and Velma.  SHAGGY Isabel?!  Isabel turns toward him. Her hair is now straight down and conservative. Her makeup is tasteful eye shadow. Her clothes are a colorful sweater-skirt combination.  ISABEL Oh, hi!  SHAGGY You\\'re here?! Why’d you leave that phone message?!  (CONTINUED) \\x0c64.  CONTINUED : Isabel giggles. ISABEL  I just thought the show was real for a minute, and, whoopsie!  SHAGGY What happened to your hair? Your clothes?  ISABEL  It was time for a change! I mean, golly-wolly, I’m a teenager! We change all the time!  Shaggy stares at her, confounded. He spots the Codst Guard walking out the front door.  SHAGGY Wait here, okay?! Just wait!  INT. DEAD MIKE’S WOMEN’S REST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER  Daphne stares at herself in the bathroom mirror. The faucet is running.  DAPHNE Okay, Daphne... Chill out... There’s some reasonable expla... Oh, God.  She leans over. She splashes water on her face. She lifts her head.  Zarkos, the masked wrestler, is in the mirror. He’s standing behind her. He grabs her.  He quickly pins her to the floor in a wrestling hold. DAPHNE No fair! Let go! This doesn’t  count! I didn’t have time to summon my chi!  EXT. DEAD MIKE’S SPORTS BAR - DAY  Shaggy and Scooby follow Raimondo and Fitzgibbon as they  pace quickly away from the bar.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c65. CONTINUED:  SHAGGY Listen! There’s something wrong with this place! You have to take all of us with you off this island!  Fitzgibbon speaks into a walkie-talkie.  FITZGIBBON Moira, do a check on a Norville ‘Shaggy’ Rogers from Coolsville, Maryland.  SHAGGY If you knew Fred and Velma or my cousin, you’d know that that was even weirder than eighteen-foot demons! Like, who says ‘Golly-  wolly’?  RAIMONDO Who says ‘zoinks’?  SCOOBY Good roint.  FITZGIBBON  (into walkie-talkie) Yeah... yeah... thanks, Moira.  RAIMONDO Rogers got a jacket?  FITZGIBBON No... but the dog has three sheets. He’s wanted on leash law violations, overdue vaccines, no registration, two acts of defecating in the park --  SHAGGY Scooby! Scooby shrugs. SCOOBY I rad do go. RAIMONDO  Yeah, Rogers, we\\'ll take you with us. But if we do, we got to put your mutt to sleep.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c66. CONTINUED:  SCOOBY  Rut I’m not rired. - SHAGGY  Sleep, Scoob. Like what happened  to Scrappy. Scooby yelps and bites his nails. Shaggy stops following them. He watches them go. He grudgingly starts back toward the bar. RAIMONDO AND FITZGIBBON  turn the corner of the bar. N’Goo Tauna and a horde of tough henchman are standing there, waiting.  RAIMONDO What the...?  INT. DEAD MIKE’S SPORTS BAR - MOMENTS LATER  Shaggy and Scooby enter. The place is suddenly abandoned. The stage is empty. The sports-horror theme is decidedly more spooky. Dummies in pro team uniforms hang from nooses. A giant shrunken head in a football helmet also dangles from the rafters.  SHAGGY Yipes. Where’d everybody go?  Scooby sees Fred THROUGH a small window on the kitchen door. He bounds toward the doors.  SCOOBY Red! INT. DEAD MIKE’S KITCHEN Scooby enters the twin doors. He sees Fred, Velma, Isabel, and some college students gathered around a small table eating cereal. FRED Hey, Scooby! You guys missed a real kicky time last night!  SCOOBY Ricky rime?  Shaggy enters behind Scooby-Doo.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c67. CONTINUED:  FRED The fellows in the demon costumes took us back to a big cavern, and we all had some scrumptious chocolate cake!  SHAGGY How could those be costumes? Fred, where’s your ascot?! Velma, you’re wearing makeup!  VELMA Doesn’t a girl have a right to look pretty every now and then?  Everybody laughs. Shaggy and Scooby look nervously at them. Velma turns away from them, gazing out a kitchen window, her back to them.  VELMA You know, one thing those monsters did was pretty scary.  Scooby stares at her, wondering.  VELMA That blood-curdling scream they let out before they attacked.  SCOOBY A ream?  Velma looks over her shoulder at a confused Scooby-Doo.  VELMA You know, sort of like...  Velma opens her mouth and releases a loud, piercing sereech. Her eyes wash over into a bright red.  Shaggy and Scooby holler. They look around them: Fred stands, throwing back his chair. Isabel jumps onto the table, crouching like a panther. Their eyes are all red. They all screech.  FRED Rixnort caal ene, topara! Ekenchumen, riko!  Shaggy and Scooby run. The possessed humans take chase. Shaggy trips, but the horde just runs over his body. They seem only to care about Scooby.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c68. CONTINUED :  Scooby gallops toward a bucket of Pine-Sol at the end of a long industrial metal table for preparing food. He scoops up the bucket and throws it onto the metal counter. He jumps onto the counter, the Pine-gol a lubricant easing his slide down its length and toward a fire exit.  Scooby slides past a long hero sandwich and OUT OF FRAME.  Quickly, Scooby reemerges IN the FRAME. The sight of the sandwich has made him forget everything.  SCOOBY Momm !  Scooby grabs a piece. Shaggy yells at him from the floor.  SHAGGY Forget the sandwich! Get out of here!  Scooby sees the horde nearing him. He leaps off the counter toward the fire exit. He slams through it. The FIRE ALARM SOUNDS.  EXT. CLIFF BEHIND DEAD MIKE’S  Scooby runs out onto a small area of grassland. The rear of Dead Mike’s sits directly on the end of an enormous cliff, hundreds of yards up from the rocky ocean. Scooby almost runs off it. He turns to see his possessed friends circling him. He stands on his hind legs, trapped.  INT. DEAD MIKE’S KITCHEN  Shaggy can see out the open door, where the possessed humans approach Scooby. He searches around the room.  SHAGGY Oh boy oh boy. Oh boy. Oh...  Shaggy looks at a wall phone. It has a very long cord.  He snatches the receiver off the hook. He ties the cord around his waist.  Shaggy takes a deep breath. He darts outside. \\x0c69. EXT. CLIFF BEHIND DEAD MIKE’S Shaggy runs between the possessed humans.  SHAGGY Hold on, Scoob!  Shaggy grabs Scooby and jumps with him off the edge of the cliff. Scooby clamps onto Shaggy.  They fall, screaming, for a bit (it’s an extraordinarily long phone cord). Then they snap to a sudden stop.  Shaggy and Scooby peer down at the waves crashing up against the rocky cliffs. They swing back and forth.  SHAGGY This stinks.  Scooby gazes up at the red-eyed humans, growling. SCOOBY Rhy are Relma and Red in ruch a rad mood? SHAGGY That’s not a bad mood, Scooby! They’re like demons!  SCOOBY Remons!?  Scooby screams at the top of his lungs for a long time. Shaggy stares at him, nonplussed. They start to rise. They look up. Fred is slowly yanking them back up. Shaggy fishes in his pocket for something. He pulls out a Red Cross knife. SHAGGY Remember when we took those diving lessons, Scoob?  Shaggy starts to cut the phone cord.  SCOOBY Ro.  SHAGGY No?!  The cord is cut. Shaggy and Scooby scream as they fall.  Scooby plummets, spinning in the air, trying to get his bearings. Finally, he does; he dives straight down.  Shaggy and Scooby hit the ocean. \\x0c70. EXT. UNDERWATER  Shaggy and Scooby submerge deep into the water.  .EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER  Scooby and Shaggy lope onto the shore. Scooby rubs his head in pain, a bit angry.  SCOOBY Roo rurt ry read. SHAGGY I what?! SCOOBY Rurt ry read. SHAGGY You know, Scoob, that’s the type of thing that pisses -- that’s  like a little bit like not grateful, don’t you think?  SCOOBY It ruts!  SHAGGY I just saved your life, man!  SCOOBY You rew re off a riff!  SHAGGY I went back for you! Which is unlike -- I’11 tell you this, man -- very unlike what you did when I got stuck in that vase. You just ran away like a little baby!  SCOOBY Rou’re a rittle raby.  SHAGGY You are!  SCOOBY Rou are!  SHAGGY  Shut up, Scooby. Velma’s right. You are a moron.  Scooby is very hurt by this.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c71. CONTINUED:  SCOOBY Rhat?  SHAGGY You heard me.  Scooby, tears in his eyes, picks up a handful of sand and throws it at Shaggy.  SHAGGY Hey!  SCOOBY I rate roo!  Scooby darts away from Shaggy, crying.  SHAGGY Scooby!  Scooby disappears into the forest. Shaggy spots thick metal cables running along the shoreline. They lead into a dark hole in a mountainside.  . SHAGGY Hypno-wheel.  (into woods) Scooby, while you’re in there moping I’m going to see where these cables go!  EXT. HOLE IN CAVERN - MOMENTS LATER  Shaggy follows the metal cables into a short hole in the side of the cavern. He crawls into the hole.  INT. CAVERN CATACOMB  Shaggy can barely see. We hear a SCREAM. He stands beside doorways lining the wall, similar to where Isabel was in the beginning of the film. He uses his hand to follow the cables on the ground.  Suddenly, he. falls, sliding down an incline and into a gushing stream.  Shaggy tries to stay above water, looking up to the hole above him.  SHAGGY Scooby!  He drifts through a dark cavity leading into a cavern. \\x0c72. INT. CAVERN BELLY - MOMENTS LATER  The stream ends in a pool in this cavern belly, which is hundreds of yards in diameter and hundreds of yards high. Shaggy stops by a boulder pile beside the pool. He crawls to his knees. He spots the metal cables emerging from the pool. He peeks around the corner of the boulder pile to see where they lead. He spies something horrible:  Raimondo, Fitzgibbon, and a few students are strapped by weathered leather straps and metal buckles into rectangular wooden slabs in the upright vertical position. Nine such slabs encircle the room. A hideous demon stands beside each of the slabs. Raimondo struggles against the straps.  RAIMONDO Get me out of here!  The cables lead to a control station, a rusty metal box with a door and a large lock. Zarkos uses a key -- exactly like the one hanging from Mondavarious’ belt -- to open the door. He steps into the control box. He puts his hands on the controls there.  The Soul Snatcher, an upright metal device with an enormous pincer on the end, is in front of the control station. Zarkos works the controls; the pincer cranes  upward. Zarkos guides the pincer toward Raimondo’s chest.  RAIMONDO loooeco0!  The pincer mystically -- that is, without bodily injury -- enters Raimondo’s chest. The pincer glows. It twists, digs, searches for something.  The pincer clamps shut; Raimondo’s body falls limp. But, strangely, though his mouth has stopped moving, we still hear him, MUFFLED, SCREAMING.  The pincer emerges from his chest, pulling something translucent white and incandescent out of Raimondo. It yanks the substance like warm taffy through a pinhole. Eventually, it’s free. We GAZE UPON...  Raimondo’s soul. It likes like Raimondo’s head, with a wispy spiral tail. He is still screaming; he stops when he sees his own limp body in front of him.  RAIMONDO’S SOUL Hey! What the --? You’re taking my _ soul out of my body?!  (CONTINUED) \\x0c73.  CONTINUED:  The demon standing beside Raimondo’s body shoves his head down the throat. He shoves his arms inside. It’s an ugly sight, but he gradually squeezes his whole shape through Raimondo’s mouth and into the soulless husk.  The pincer swings Raimondo’s soul over to the Soul Stew, an eight foot high rusty iron van that sits in the center ef the room. It’s filled with a white, mystical brew. DIM VOICES ECHO from it. The pincer stuffs Raimondo’s shell-shocked soul into the Soul Stew.  Raimondo’s body’s eyes open. Workers unstrap him.  Raimondo manipulates his face, getting used to being in the body. He rotates his shoulders. He sits up.  RAIMONDO Ak orton.  He wiggles his fingers. In stilted English:  RAIMONDO Flesh-ee.  Shaggy sinks back against the boulder, afraid to even breathe.  EXT. FOREST  A muddied Scooby-Doo crosses the forest. He hears:  DAPHNE (V.0.) Scooby!  Daphne is crouched in the bushes beside him.  SCOOBY Raphre!  Tears well up in Scooby’s eyes.  SCOOBY Raggy rurt ry reelings!  Daphne extends her hand toward Scooby.  DAPHNE It’ll be okay. Come with me, puppy -  Scooby hesitantly puts his paw in her hand. He looks behind him, to see if Shaggy has followed.  Daphne’s eyes turn red behind him. \\x0c74. INT. CAVERN BELLY Shaggy continues to watch from behind the boulder pile.  The Upper Crust Coed who sat next to Scooby on the plane appears in a doorway.  COED Bort r-Immin tarken.  The possessed Coast Guard and students follow her through the doorway. Everyone’s gone.  Shaggy takes a deep breath for courage. He steps out of the pool of water.  Shaggy creeps up the steps to the Soul Stew. He puts his hands on the edge of the vat. Peers down into it.  SHAGGY zZoinks.  OVERHEAD SHOT  Inside the vat are hundreds of SOULS, white translucent faces, swirling, agonized, SCREAMING and CHATTERING and WHISPERING their secrets.  SHAGGY notices Velma’s Soul, circling.  VELMA’S SOUL Shaggy! Give me a hand! Get me out of here!  It circles up and away from Shaggy and then swings back around again.  SHAGGY How?!  VELMA’S SOUL Don’t tell me all those years of video games haven’t given you eye- hand coordination!  Shaggy fearfully, yet with amazing reflexes, plunges his ~ hand in the vat and snatches up Velma’s Soul. He holds it up. She’s dizzy.  VELMA’S SOUL Oh, man.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c75. CONTINUED:  SHAGGY Fred said it was a hypno-wheel! I would have never come if I knew there was a thing that pulled a you out of you and put a mean thing inside of it!  VELMA’S SOUL Stop with the technical jargon.  SHAGGY What?!  VELMA’S SOUL Get the others. They should be on the top layer, since we were the last ones put in there.  SHAGGY What about you?  VELMA’S SOUL If my instincts are correct, just let me go. We’1ll meet you on the beach at the base of the mountain.  SHAGGY Let go?  Velma nods. Shaggy, unsure, releases her soul. She shoots away in a dazzling trichromatic streak of light and out of the cavern.  EXT. FOREST  Evil Daphne and her cohorts carry a bamboo pole with an upset Scooby-Doo tied upside down to it. He gulps. Evil Velma follows, overseeing things. They all sing:  HUMANS Ko reeka gort an alla soy Go balli lala gingo hoy A raefa morr ay ach otee This demon world forever be!  The multicolored streak of Velma’s Soul zips behind them, smack into the possessed Velma’s face. None of the other humans notice as she’s knocked off her feet.  Velma’s Soul oozes into the mouth of the prone Velma. It travels through her neck like a rat through a snake. The body quakes and, suddenly...  (CONTINUED) \\x0c76. CONTINUED:  A monstrous demon springs from her chest. Slats of daylight stream down through the limbs of trees beside the demon. Where the light meets the demon’s body, the demon burns. He opens his mouth to scream, but instead ’ EXPLODES into glowing, protoplasmic chunks.  Velma covers her face to protect herself; but the chunks dissipate into nothing.  She looks at the others, still carrying Scooby down the forest pathway. They’ve noticed nothing.  INT. CAVERN BELLY  Shaggy snatches another soul out of the vat. It’s’a MAN’S SOUL.  MAN’S SOUL You’ve saved me! Thank you! Thank you so much!  SHAGGY Sorry, I’m, uh, looking for my friend.  Shaggy stuffs the Man’s Soul back into the stew. He grabs another.  It’s FRED’S SOUL. Shaggy holds it upside down by its wispy spinal tail. Fred is, to say the least, rattled.  FRED\\'S SOUL Listen, man! I think someone spiked my root beer with crack last night, and I’m having like a -- a bad trip!  SHAGGY Shhhi  FRED’S SOUL Talk me down, pal! I’m having a ‘bummer’ !  SHAGGY Sbh. A demon took over your body.  FRED’S SOUL A ‘demon’? Shaggy, cut the superstitious claptrap! At the end of every paranormal claim there are only fools seeking fame, paranoid --  (CONTINUED) \\x0c77.  CONTINUED: SHAGGY Fred, you’re a frigging see- ~  through protoplasmic head! Shaggy looks around, afraid someone heard.  SHAGGY Sorry... Shhh... Um... bye?  FRED’S SOUL What?  Shaggy releases Fred’s Soul. It flies off in a colorful streak.  INT. FRED’S HOTEL BATHROOM  The possessed Fred is in the steamed-up shower, sponging himself and singing along to the song on the radio, TEARS FOR FEARS \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World.\"  Fred’s SOUL WHOOSHES into the bathroom. It smacks against the shower door and bounces off.  FRED’S SOUL ow!  Unable to get in the shower, it flies out of the bathroom.  INT. FRED’S HOTEL ROOM  Fred’s Soul ricochets around the hotel room.  FRED’S SOUL Ow!... Owl... Owl... Ow!  Then it bounces out the open window.  INT. CAVERN BELLY Shaggy yanks DAPHNE’S SOUL out of the vat. She’s pissed. DAPHNE’S SOUL Put me back, Shaggy! I don’t want to be saved again! I’11 figure a way out myself!  SHAGGY Like, how?  (CONTINUED) \\x0c78. CONTINUED:  DAPHNE’S SOUL I‘ll, I don’t know, use my tongue as an oar to swim to the edge!  EXT. CATACOMB CORRIDOR  Daphne and the other demons carry Scooby on the bamboo pole into the staff door Isabel and Mandy sneaked into at the beginning of the film. Velma tails them. She leaves the door open behind her.  INT. CATACOMB CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER  The possessed humans carry Scooby down the corridor. They pass a few doorways.

The rest of the humans walk by without noticing.  INT. SMALL CATACOMB ROOM  The room is very dark. The soul flies into Daphne’s face. Daphne’s body shivers.  An ENORMOUS DEMON pops out of her chest. Only this time he doesn’t explode. The Demon looks at Daphne.  DEMON Jonlovroen kantu... human!  The Demon picks up the confused Daphne by the neck and slams her against the rocky wall.

Velma snickers. Daphne’s mood shifts as she realizes something. She runs her hands over her sides. She smiles.  DAPHNE  I can go look at myself naked!  Holy God, I can try out things I  never imagined in even most  outlandish fantasies! I -- There’s a SLAM against the door. Velma opens it. Daphne’s Soul flies into the mouth of her body.

The Metal Head’s long locks are now a crew cut. Scooby catches his eye through the rusty metal bars between them. He points to the equation.  The Metal head sees it and mellowly shakes his head now.  Scooby looks around the murky dungeon. A mischievous look crosses his face; he has an idea.  Scooby clutches his heart. He wheezes. He’s pretending to have a heart attack.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c81.

A holographic tube of souls pop up fromthe stew.  It reaches up to the ceiling.  Scooby looks up at it. He playfully dips his paw into it.  MONDAVARIOUS The soul tube is a shuttle, if you will, between earth and the demon realm. I’ve used sorcery to summon low-level demons over the years. But only through this tube can we transport the Demon Rex.  Mondavarious flicks another switch.  A red holographic Demon Rex slowly descends through the tunnel of souls.  Scooby points to a plaster kitten, with a spring for a neck, on Mondavarious’s desk.  SCOOBY Rhat’s dat?  MONDAVARIOUS That’s a cat with a bobbing head.  Scooby slaps its head, making it bob. It amuses hin.  MONDAVARIOUS Please don’t touch it. It has nothing to do with this.  Mondavarious flicks another switch; holograms of other demons follow the Demon Rex down the tube.

She wears her leather eggplant body suit, and has an enormous backpack.  She lands on the mountain in a cat-like crouch.  INT. CAVERN BELLY  Velma, Fred and Shaggy venture into the enormous cavern. A DEMON stands beside one of the slabs, waiting to  inhabit Shaggy’s body. Shaggy whispers through clenched teeth.  SHAGGY This, like, isn’t cool! How are you going to get rid of that guy?  Fred and Velma each draw two high-powered flashlights, one in each hand. They point the flashlights at the Demon. Four small beams appear on the monster. His skin smokes.  DEMON #2 Ahrloeg!

Deathly talons sprout from his wings. His thin disgusting tongue flips up over his face, slithering over his steely sharp beak. There is nothing beautiful about this creature. Nothing tender.

DAPHNE Not --  Daphne frees her leg and kicks Zarkos in his head.  DAPHNE This --  Zarkos stumbles. Daphne back-flips to standing.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c105. CONTINUED:  DAPHNE Time! -     Zarkos comes toward her. With one swift flying, swirling kick to his chest, she knocks him backwards.  Zarkos stumbles backwards, so that he almost topples into the hole in the roof. Daphne grabs the terrified wrestler by his suspenders. She drapes him over the open hole. His boots barely graze the ledge. The soul tube vacillates behind him. She puts her face in close to his.  DAPHNE  Now who\\'s the damsel in distress?! ZARKOS  «+. Me? DAPHNE  Straight up.  Daphne drops him. He screams as he plummets to his demise.  INT. CAVERN BELLY  Shaggy falls to the floor. The Scooby Rex raises his paw over him, to squash him, then stops. He sees Zarkos falling into the pit.  FRED  runs toward the vertical palanquin. He leaps over a demon, and onto a small platform beneath it. He rips away the mattress (which is attached by Velcro). And there, scrawled in huge letters on the wood board, it reads:  12 + 7 = 19     Zarkos’ key rests on the inside rim. Fred smiles.  SCOOBY’S SOUL twisting in the tunnel, chuckles.  FRED Shaggy! \\x0c106. SCOOBY REX  looks down to squash Shaggy, but he is no longer there. He looks over and sees.  * SHAGGY standing at the control station.  Fred tosses the key. It spins over the heads of the demons. Shaggy catches it.  He goes to unlock the control station door.  EXT. CAVERN BELL ROOF  Daphne flicks the switch on the spotlight.  INT. CAVERN BELLY  The beam shoots down into the room. It eradicates a few demons flying in its path.  The beam impotently hits stone where the mirror fell.  Velma, however, is standing beneath the beam. She casually picks up the mirror from the floor.  The demons are staring at her.  SKELETAL CREEP Who are you?!  VELMA The Velmster.  MONKEY DEMON What are you?!  Beat.  VELMA I’m a hero.  Velma thrusts the mirror high over her head. The spotlight strikes it.  The beam reflects from the wall mirror to mirror to mirror throughout the room, a complex geometric pattern. It bursts through demons in its path, destroying almost all of them. \\x0c107. SHAGGY  shoves Mondavarious out of the way. The control station controls are identical to the arcade crane controls at  the airport. Shaggy confidently thrust a lever to the side.  The pincer swoops over in front of the Scooby Rex. SHAGGY It’s one thing that you wanted to take over the world.  The pincer jabs into a disconcerted Scooby Rex’s chest. it twists.  SHAGGY But you shouldn’t have messed --  Shaggy wrenches the Demon Rex out of Scooby-Doo’ body. He swings the Demon Rex into the bottom of the soul tube.  SHAGGY -- with my pet!  Shaggy opens the pincer. The Demon Rex flies screaming into the tube, upward toward the sky. He is unable to grip onto the sides with his talons.  DEMON REX Noooc0c00090000!  All of the other demons, due to the Demon Rex’s gravitational force, are instantaneously yanked from their human forms.  The bodies fall limp.  The DEMONS WHOOSH into the tube behind the Demon Rex.  INT. PUB (IRELAND) - NIGHT  The Irish Lad looks surprised for a moment, and then the demon’s soul is ripped from his body. It sweeps over the drinkers’ heads and through an open window.  INT. AUDITORIUM (NEW ZEALAND) - DAY  The astonished crowd watches as a huge, screaming demon flies over them and away from Juliet’s body. The demon flies out an open window and...  EXT. AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND  Over the cityscape of Auckland. \\x0c108. EXT. SPOOKY ISLAND  Demons rush in a blur to the island, one by one, from all directions, streaming toward the mountain entrance. INT. CAVERN BELLY  Velma and Fred lie on the ground. They cover their heads as hundreds of DEMONS WOOSH over their bodies and up into the soul tube.  And then it stops. The room is momentarily quiet.  EXT. CAVERN BELLY ROOF  Daphne stands before the soul tube. It is no longer twisting. The faces aren’t screaming. A woman’s soul stares at Daphne; she appears peaceful.  DAPHNE Isabel?  ISABEL Thank you.  The tube begins to crumble. The souls chip off and stream away in trichromatic colors, off into the night sky.  INT. CAVERN BELLY  Scooby-Doo’s Soul colorfully zooms across the cavern.  SCOOBY’S SOUL Yeah yeah yeah!  He splashes into his again normal-sized body, sparkling.  In colorful bursts, the souls zip around a smiling Velma and Fred and out through the cavern’s halls.  DAPHNE  rappels down in through the hole of the roof. The colorful BALLS WHOOSH around her.  Other souls enter other formerly-possessed bodies on the ground. They wake. They rise. \\x0c109. SCOOBY -DOO  paws playfully at the bright balls zipping over his head.  SCOOBY It\\'s rootiful!  VELMA  smiles at Mandy. She helps her up.  FRED  gives Raimondo a hand.  EXT. BASKETBALL LOT (KENYA) - DAY  The crowd watches as a colorful ball of light travels over their heads and lands with a sparkling burst into the prone body of the Player.  He opens his eyes, wondering where he is.  INT. LIBRARY (COOLSVILLE) - NIGHT  Angel stands, running her hands over her body. Tears £ill her eyes.  EXT. PUB (IRELAND) - NIGHT  The Irish Lad whoops. He kisses a fat, ugly woman.  INT. FAMILY DINING ROOM (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT  The Older Brother and Father embrace Beth Anne and Brian. They’re crying. The Mother grabs Brian’s chin.  MOTHER We wondered where you went.  Brian rubs his hand over his crew cut.  BRIAN I though you wanted me to cut off my hair.  MOTHER  We loved you the way you were. \\x0c110.  INT. CAVERN BELLY  Everyone in the cavern is standing. Velma gives Shaggy a big bear hug. Someone taps him on the back. He turns to see Isabel. She’s crying.  ISABEL Hey, cuz.  SHAGGY Izzy!  Shaggy and Isabel embrace.  DAPHNE gives Fred a little punch on the shoulder.  DAPHNE We did it.  Fred gives her a little punch back.  FRED Yes, we did!  They stop. They stare into each other’s eyes. Their breath quickens as their desire rushes to the surface.  They embrace and kiss passionately. Then, as quickly as it started, Daphne catches her lapse of reason and pushes Fred away.  DAPHNE Fred, cut your crap! FRED Aha! You kissed me back! DAPHNE No, I didn’t. FRED  (to a guy beside them) She used tongue.  DAPHNE He\\'s lying! SCOOBY -DOO  Wanders nervously through the jubilation, looking for someone. He hears a voice behind him:  (CONTINUED) \\x0c111. CONTINUED:  SHAGGY (0.S.) Scooby!  Scooby turns, tongue wagging, legs splayed.  SCOOBY Raggy!  Scooby gallops toward Shaggy. He leaps, flying through the air. He lands on Shaggy’s chest, knocking him over.  SCOOBY Rooby do good?!  SHAGGY Yes, you did!  SCOOBY Rooby rot a ronon?  SHAGGY Like, not at all, buddy.  SCOOBY Raggy roves Rooby again?!  SHAGGY I always did.  SCOOBY  And Rooby roves Raggy!  Scooby-Doo pins Shaggy there, licking his face. Shaggy laughs and protests the huge tongue, trying to stop it, but Scooby just can’t give his best friend enough love.  SHAGGY Ha hal Cut it out, Scoob!  N‘GOO  appears over Shaggy. A nearly-sobbing Mondavarious is by N‘Goo’s side. Scooby-Doo gulps, and, just like he did when Shaggy was stuck in the vase, he starts to run away.  N‘Goo grabs Shaggy’s neck. He lifts him off the floor.  MONDAVARIOUS You! You have eradicated a lifetime’s worth of work! Kill him, N’Goo! Snap his neck like the weasel he is!  (CONTINUED) \\x0c112. CONTINUED:  Shaggy can hardly breathe or speak.  SHAGGY Scoob...  MONDAVARIOUS That mangy rodent? Ha! He’s a coward! Sniveling and shivering and shaking, like so much...  Mondavarious and N’Goo hear a LOUD GROWLING. They turn.  Scooby-Doo stands, haunched. The fur on his back is  sticking up.. His fangs are exposed. He appears huge and frightening.  SCOOBY Reave Raggy rarone.  He barrels toward them. Mondavarious and N’Goo’s expressions drop. They scream.  Scooby-Doo is a saber-tooth tiger leaping at his prey.  INT. COAST GUARD STATION - DAY (NEWS FOOTAGE)  Press bulbs flash on Mondavarious and N’Goo. They are handcuffed and thoroughly beaten-up.  A throng of CORRESPONDENTS gathers around the gang. They stick their microphones in Fred’s face.  CORESPONDENT Fred, can you tell us how you masterminded the apprehension of Raphael Mondavarious?  FRED Yes! It all started when I was  giving a speech at Coolsville, and --  Fred notices Velma standing quietly beside them, gazing at the floor.  FRED And I think, really, that the Velmster should take it from there.  The Correspondents all thrust their mikes toward a surprised Velma. Her eyes smile warmly at Fred.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c113. CONTINUED:  VELMA Yes. Firstly, we don’t believe there is any such person as Raphael Mondavarious. We came to the conclusion that he’s actually --  With the dexterity of Vanna White turning letters, Daphne pulls off the Mondavarious mask to reveal...  VELMA  Garret Rogers, Shaggy’s uncle. It makes sense: He wanted Scooby-Doo to be part of his evil plan, so he prodded us into coming to Spooky  Island... At least that’s what we thought until we called Garret in Coolsville and he was still home.  Consequently, this is just another mask covering his real identity --  Daphne pulls a Garret mask off to reveal...  VELMA Fred Jones, who set up the whole situation just so Mystery Ink would return to the spotlight!  PAN TO Fred, who is hurt by the accusation.  FRED But I’m standing right here.  VELMA Right. It was ludicrous that we suspected Fred, since we’ve often seen he and Mondavarious together. So it could only be the one person so unmercifully nefarious as to concoct this evil scheme.  Daphne yanks off the Fred mask to reveal...  VELMA Don Knotts!  CORESPONDENT Mr. Furley?  (CONTINUED) \\x0c114. CONTINUED:  DON KNOTTS  And I would have gotten away with it, too, if not for these meddling kids! They’re horrid! You should have seen what that disgusting animal did at my Christmas party!  (re: Fred) And him! I figured out the mystery of Moody Manner and he took all the credit!  FRED Sorry, Don. But that’s no reason to freak out like a jerk and kill humanity.  DON KNOTTS L tts! IF am master of hell! All_ shall bow before my unyielding power! You stupid sons-of-bi--!  The TV shuts OFF.  INT. DAPHNE’S DINING ROOM - DAY  Daphne removes the videotape from the player. Velma, Shaggy, Fred, and Scooby are sitting around a dining room table with empty plates and glasses. Shaggy is wearing a green T-shirt with a demon eating a baby’s head on it. They applaud and laugh.  DAPHNE I know we’ve seen it before, but every time I really get a kick...  FRED Velmster did a bang-up job. It’s no surprise that Yale offered her that professorship.  VELMA You hear about Fred?  They look at him.  FRED Not to toot my own horn, but I’ve pre-sold two hundred thousand copies of my new book, Why Skeptics Suck Ass.  SHAGGY Groovy!  (CONTINUED) \\x0c115.  CONTINUED:  Daphne looks at her watch.  DAPHNE Shoot! I’ve got to go. Sorry. I’ve got rehearsal.  FRED Rehearsal?  SHAGGY Daphne got cast as the lead in the new action flick, Mean Hard Revenge II.  Scooby-Doo does some kung-fu moves.  SCOOBY Roh! Hee-rah!  Everyone laughs. Not looking where he’s throwing his  Scooby chops Shaggy in the face.  SHAGGY Ow!  SCOOBY Rorry.  EXT. DAPHNE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER  The gang crosses the lawn, toward their cars. The Mystery Machine is in the driveway.  FRED Thanks. for lunch, Daph. That was nice of you!  SCOOBY Yeah yeah yeah! Ranks!  DAPHNE  I hope we can make it a regular thing.  Velma opens her car door. She stops.  VELMA Shaggy, you didn’t say what you were doing.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c116. CONTINUED :  SHAGGY Oh, like, nothing much. Scooby and me, we just got a, you know, mysterious call.  DAPHNE A mysterious call?  SHAGGY I don’t know. They said they were from the Jell-O pudding factory and there were some sort of sightings of, like, a Jell-o Chocolate Pudding monster. Then they hung up.  SCOOBY Yeah yeah. Rell-o!  Everyone stops and looks at him.  DAPHNE Oh. FRED  Hm... Well, good-bye, everybody.  SHAGGY VELMA See ya! So long, folks.  DAPHNE SCOOBY Bye. Rye-rye!  Fred steps into the Mystery Machine. Velma gets into her Dodge. Daphne walks toward the door.  EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER  Shaggy and Scooby head down the sidewalk.  DAPHNE (0.S.) Shaggy!  They turn to see Daphne behind them. DAPHNE What kind of chocolate pudding monster?  Velma pulls her Dodge in front of them.  (CONTINUED) \\x0cCONTINUED:  117.  VELMA That’s what I was thinking! Is it a monster... or could it be a ghost?  SHAGGY Like, it’s probably just a man in a mas--  FRED (0.S.)  Don’t jump to conclusions, Shag!  Fred steps out of the Mystery Machine behind Shaggy.  FRED If you expect it to be a man ina mask, then when it ends up being a protoplasmic alien life form animating an edible substance, it’ll take you unaware, perhaps shooting acidic wads of pudding at your head, tearing off your face!  SHAGGY That’s exactly what Scooby said!  Scooby-Doo gives Fred the thumbs-up. Velma pulls out a cell phone. Dials it.  VELMA This sounds pretty serious. You might need, you know... (to phone) Sarah? Velma Dinkley. I’m not going to be in for a couple weeks...  DAPHNE Right. I can always be in Mean Hard Revenge TIT.  FRED This could be dangerous. Someone of my physical prowess could come in handy, opening lodged doors, etcetera.  Shaggy shrugs.  SHAGGY Sure.  Fred claps. The gang moves toward the Mystery Machine.  (CONTINUED) \\x0c118. CONTINUED:  FRED Ha! Chocolate pudding bastard, here we come! I’11 drive!  VELMA Shotgun!  DAPHNE Darn it! I was going to say that!  VELMA  Why don’t we all just ride in the front seat?!  Fred, Daphne, and Velma jump into the Mystery Machine.  Scooby-Doo and Shaggy trot toward the van after them. Scooby looks up at his beatnik pal.  SCOOBY Raggy. Dere’s no rocolate rudding ronster.  SHAGGY  Like, no, Scooby, there isn’t. But, they all looked, like, sad. After all, it’s better than chasing nothing with your friends, than to chase something with no one at all.  Scooby smiles. He bounds toward the Mystery Machine.  SCOOBY Rooby-Dooby-Doo!  Scooby and Shaggy hop into the van. They close the door.  FRED (0.S.) Ha ha! Do that again, Scoob!  SCOOBY (0.S.) Rooby-Dooby-Doo!  FRED (0.8.) I’m going to start doing that. Fred!  DAPHNE (0.S.) Fred, please don’t!  FRED (0.S.) Fred Jones!  (CONTINUED) \\x0c119.  CONTINUED: _ DAPHNE (0.S.) It’s his thing. Why do you have to steal everybody else’s thing?  FRED (0.S.) Sorry, sorry...  The Mystery Machine hits the road.  FADE OUT.  THE END \\x0c'"
